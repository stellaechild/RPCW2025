Then you're gonna make a sugar syrup with 2 parts sugar, 1 part water (4 cups water, 2 cups white granulated sugar) in the same manner over high heat until it mixes, and then add the gum syrup to the mix until everything dissolves and what you're left with is a thick gummy syrup that resembles a whole lot of baby batter. Then cut up 1.5 cups of pineapple chunks, put in mason jar, and pour the gum syrup over it and let it sit in the refrigerator over night. A few hours would work also if you don't have that much time. However, the more time, the more pineapple infusion takes place. When it's ready, strain into another mason jar or bottle, and it's ready to go."

Toast the dried chiles and soak in water for at least an hour until they are rehydrated. Drain and discard the soaking liquid. Combine the soaked chiles with the remaining ingredients and pur\u00e9e until smooth.    Cold smoke a rack of baby back pork ribs by taking a large hotel pan with woodchips on one side and charcoal on the other. Place another, smaller, pan with pork ribs, above the charcoal/woodchip pan. Ignite the charcoal, being careful to not ignite the woodchips. Cover both pans with foil and allow to smoke for 10-15 minutes, until desired level of smoke is achieved, then coat with adobo marinade and wrap in tin foil prior to placing ribs in a 300 degree oven for 7 hours. When the ribs have cooled, strain off the fat and use for the infusion.    If you\u2019re having a hard time coming up to the same kind of volume of fat, make up the balance with pork lard from a butcher. To get the same depth of flavor without the ribs, heat up the fat in a pot with a few spoons of the marinade.    Once you\u2019ve got your tub of seasoned pork fat in cooled liquid form, pour equal amounts of Ilegal Joven mezcal and fat into a sealable container. Seal the container and give it a really good shake, then put it in the freezer overnight. When the whole thing is separated and congealed, pour it through a fine mesh chinoise. If you don\u2019t have a chinoise, try a fine mesh strainer, or if you don\u2019t have one of those, try spooning off most of the fat. There will be some beads of orange fat left in the strained mezcal: run that through a few layers of cheesecloth (or coffee filters in a pinch) to get rid of the last of it.    The mezcal is now ready for drinking, straight-up or in a cocktail.     Habanero tincture    Slice habaneros and add 2 ounces Ilegal Joven mezcal.  Allow to sit overnight or until desired level of heat is achieved.  Cocktail    Combine mezcal and chocolate liqueur in a mixing glass with ice and stir for 45 seconds.  Strain into chilled coupe.  Carefully \"sink\" the coffee liqueur down the inside of the coupe over a spoon.  Garnish with 5 drops habanero tincture."

The second step is to fill half the glass with ice and add one or two shooter glasses full of high quality Tequila. The next stage is to add the flavouring elements. This is done by squeezing a fresh lime into the glass, adding a few grains of salt, adding citrus-flavoured soda pop, until the glass is 4/5 full, and then adding spicy Viuda de Sanchez (or orange juice, lime juice and pico de gallo). The final step is to stir the ingredients so that the flavours are properly blended."
